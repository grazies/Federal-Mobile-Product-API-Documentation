  "body": "# Federal Mobile Product API Documentation\r\n\r\nThe Federal Mobile Product API has been replaced by the U.S. Digital Registry API which serves as the authoritative resource for agencies, citizens and developers to confirm the official status of social media and public-facing collaboration accounts, mobile apps and mobile websites.\r\n\r\nData fields in the registry include the agency, platform, account, language, points of contact and collaborative tags.\r\n\r\nDevelopers are encouraged to use the API to verify the thousands of official accounts and mobile apps in order to maintain trust in official public service engagements, and build new user-centered programs to empower citizens.  The API currently feeds [USA.gov’s Federal Mobile Apps Directory](https://www.usa.gov/mobile-apps) and [GobiernoUSA.gov's Directorio Federal de Aplicaciones (Apps) Móviles](https://gobierno.usa.gov/apps-moviles) page(s).\r\n\r\nYou can view both the [interactive documentation](https://socialmobileregistry.digitalgov.gov/#swagger-api-docs) and [open source code](https://github.com/GSA/social-media-registry); if you are using the API and have feedback or want to tell us about your product, please email us at <socialmediaregistry@gsa.gov>.
